## What is Learning?

### Focused vs Diffuse Thinking

#### Introduction to the Focused and Diffuse Modes

- Two fundamentally different modes of thinking: **Focused** and **Diffuse** modes
- **Focused**: concentrating intently on something to learn or to understand
- **Diffuse**: relaxed thinking style related to a set of neural resting states
- Both metaphor and analogy are really helpful when trying to learn something new
- Focused mode is like a pinball machine with tight spacing between bumpers
  - Ball moves around in a tight pattern over familiar pathways
  - Mode used when working on something related to familiar concepts
- Diffuse mode is like a pinball machine with widely spaced bumpers
  - Ball travels far and wide before hitting a bumper
  - In this mode things are viewed from a broad, big picture perspective
  - Mode is used when concepts are new or new ideas are needed
- Current neuroscience indicates one is either in the focused mode or diffuse mode
  - Being in one seems to limit access to the other mode

#### Using the Focused and Diffuse Modes

- Dali and Edison used similar techniques to use both modes of thinking
  1. Relax in a chair with a key (Dali) or ball bearings (Edison) in hand above floor
  1. Let mind go free, often vaguely thinking of the problem
  1. Fall asleep, letting the item fall to the floor and waking them up
  1. Return to focused mode with new connections made from diffuse mode
- When learning something new, important to go between the two modes
- Summary
  - Anaologies provide powerful techniques for learning
  - Focused and diffuse modes help us learn but in different ways
  - Learning something difficult takes time, as the brain needs to alternate modes

### Procrastination, Memory, and Sleep

#### A Procrastination Preview

- Everyone struggles to some extent with procrastination
- When we think about something we don't want to do, we activate the pain centers in the brain
  - The brain switches attention to something else to stop negative stimulation
- Process of procrastination
  1. Observe and get a cue about something that causes a bit of unease
  1. To make the sensation go away, turn attention from whatever caused unease toward something more pleasant
  1. Feel happier, temporarily
- Researchers discovered that not long after starting work on what caused discomfort, the neuro-discomfort disappeared
- Pomodoro technique can help with procrastination
  1. Set a timer to 25 minutes, turn off all interruptions
  1. Focus on task
  1. Reward yourself when done, allowing your brain to change its focus for a while

#### Practice Makes Permanent

- Neurons become linked together through repeated use
- The more abstract something is, the more important it is to practice in order to bring those ideas into reality
- Practice makes permanent
  - When you first begin to understand something, the neural pattern form is there but very weak
  - When you solve the problem again fresh from the start, without looking at the solution, you deepen the neuron pattern
  - When you have the problem down cold, so you can go over each step completely and concisely in your mind without even looking at the solution, and you've even had practice on related problems, then the pattern is dark and firm
- When learning, study it hard by focusing intently, then take a break or at least change focus to something different for a while
  - During this time, the brain's diffuse mode has a chance to work away in the background and help with conceptual understanding

#### Introduction to Memory

- **Working memory** (short-term memory) is the part of memory that has to do with what is immediately and consciously processing in your mind
- Working memory is centered out of the prefrontal cortex
- It's now widely believed the working memory holds only about **four chunks** of
- Although working memory is like a blackboard, it's not a very good blackboard
  - Often need to keep repeating what you are trying to work with so it stays in working memory
- **Long-term memory**, is like a storage warehouse
- Like a warehouse, it's distributed over a big area
- Research has shown when first putting short-term memory in long-term memory, you need to revisit it at least a few times to increase the chances of accessing it later
- It takes time and practice to move information into long-term memory
- To help with this process, use a technique called spaced repetition
  - Repeating what you're trying to retain spaced out over a number of days
  - Extending practice over several days makes a difference

#### The Importance of Sleep in Learning

- Just being awake creates toxic products in the brain
- During sleep, brain cells shrink, causing an increase in the space between cells, allowing fluid to flow past the cells and wash the toxins out
- Sleep is actually the brain's way of keeping itself clean and healthy
- Sleep does more than just allow the brain to wash away toxins; it's an important part of the memory and learning process
- During sleep, the brain:
  - Tidies up ideas and concepts
  - Erases the less important parts of memories and simultaneously strengthens areas that you need or want to remember
  - Rehearses some of the tougher parts of whatever you're trying to learn, going over and over neural patterns to deepen and strengthen them
- Sleep has also been shown to make a remarkable difference in the ability to figure out difficult problems and to understand what you're trying to learn
- Dreaming about what you're studying can substantially enhance your ability to understand
  - If you're going over what you're learning right before you take a nap or going to sleep for the evening you have an increased chance of dreaming about it
  - If you go even further and set it in mind that you want to dream about the material, it seems to improve your chances of dreaming about

## Chunking

### Chunking – The Essentials

#### What is a Chunk?

- Chunking is the mental leap that helps unite bits of information together through meaning
- The new logical whole makes the chunk easier to remember and also makes it easier to fit the chunk into the larger picture
- Focusing attention to connect parts of the brain to tie together ideas is an important part of the focused mode of learning
- One of the first steps towards gaining expertise in academic topics is to create conceptual chunks, uniting scattered bits of information through meaning
- The concept of neural chunks also applies to sports, music, dance, really just about anything that humans can get good at
- Focused practice and repetition helps yto create chunks
- Once you chunk an idea, a concept, or an action, you don't need to remember all the little underlying details

#### How to form a Chunk

- The first step in chunking is to **focus undivided attention** on the information you want to chunk
- The second step in chunking is to **understand the basic idea** you're trying to chunk
- The third step to chunking is **gaining context** so you can see not just how but also when to use this chunk

#### Illusions of Competence

- One of the most common approaches for trying to learn material from a book or from notes is simply to reread it
- This approach is \much less productive than another, very simple, technique: **recall**
- After reading the material, simply look away and see what you can recall
- Research showed by simply practicing and recalling the material, students learned far more and at a much deeper level than they did using any other approach
- This improved learning comes whether students take a formal test or just informally test themselves
- The retrieval process itself enhances deep learning and helps us to begin forming chunks
- It's almost as if the recall process helps build in little neural hooks to hang our thinking upon
- The only time rereading text seems to be effective, is if you let time pass between the rereading so that it becomes more of an exercise in spaced repetition
- Merely glancing at a solution and thinking you truly know it yourself is one of the most common illusions of competence in learning
- Spending a lot of time with learning material doesn't guarantee you'll actually learn it
- Recalling material when you are outside your usual place of study can also help strengthen your grasp of the material

### Seeing the Bigger Picture

#### The Value of a Library of Chunks

- The ability to combine chunks in new and original ways underlies a lot of historical innovation
- The bigger and more well practiced your chunked mental library the more easily you'll be able to solve problems and figure out solution
- Chunks can also help you understand new concepts
- Chunks can be related in surprising ways to similar chunks, not only in that field but also in very different fields
  - This idea is called **transfer**
- As you gain more experience in chunking in a particular subject, you'll see that the chunks you're able to create are bigger
- In building a chunked library, you're training your brain to recognize not only a specific concept, but different types and classes of concepts so that you can automatically know how to solve quickly or handle whatever you encounter
- There are two ways to figure something out or to solve problems:
  1. Sequential step by step reasoning
     - Sequential thinking, where each small step leads deliberately towards a solution, involves the focused mode
  1. Through a more holistic intuition
     - Intuition seems to require the creative diffuse mode linking of several seemingly different focused mode thoughts
- Most difficult problems and concepts are grasped through intuition because these new ideas make a leap away from what you're familiar with
- The diffuse mode's semi-random way of making connections means the solutions they provide should be very carefully verified using the focused mode
  - Intuitive insights aren't always correct

#### Overlearning, Chocking, Einstellung, and Interleaving

- Continuing to study or practice after you've mastered what you can in the session is called **overlearning**
- Once you have the basic idea down during a session, continuing to hammer away at it during the same session doesn't strengthen the kinds of long-term memory connections you want to have strengthened
- Using a subsequent study session to repeat what you are trying to learn is just fine and often valuable
- You want to balance your studies by deliberately focusing on what you find more difficult
- Focusing on the more difficult material is called **deliberate practice**
- **Einstellung** German word means mindset
  - Phenomenon where an initial simple thought that may prevent a better idea or solution from being found
- The best way to learn is by jumping back and forth between problems or situations that require different techniques or strategies: called **interleaving**
  - You want your brain to become used to the idea that just knowing how to use a particular concept, approach, or problem-solving technique isn't enough: you also need to know when to use it
- Interleaving is extraordinarily important at it is interleaving that starts building flexibility and creativity

## Procrastination and Memory

### Procrastination

#### Zombies Everywhere

- Neuro-scientifically speaking, chunking is related to habit
- Habit is an energy saver
- It allows us to free our mind for other types of activities
- We go into this habitual **zombie mode** often without realizing it
- Habit has four parts:
  1. The **Cue** triggers that launches us into zombie mode
  1. The **routine** is the habitual response the brain is used to falling into when it receives the cue
     - Can be useful, harmless, or harmful
  1. The **reward** gives an immediate feeling of pleasure
  1. The **belief** is why habits have power

#### Surf's Up: Process vs Product

- It is perfectly normal to start with a few negative feelings about beginning a learning session, even when it is an enjoyable subject
- What matters is how the feelings are handled
  - Researchers found that non-procrastinators put negative thinking aside
- Another helpful way to avoid procrastination is to focus on process not product
  - **Process** means the flow of time and the habits and actions associated with the flow of time (e.g., spending 20 minutes working)
  - **Product** is an outcome (e.g., a completed homework assignment)
- Focus on the process or processes – the small chunks of time needed over days or even weeks to complete the product
- One of the easiest ways to focus on process is to focus on doing a Pomodoro, a 25 minute timed work session
- The essential idea is the zombie mode (habitual) part of the brain likes processes because it can march mindlessly along

#### Harnessing Your Zombies to Help You

- Don't want to do a full scale change of old habits, just override parts of them and develop a few new ones
- The trick to overriding a habit (e.g., procrastination) is to change reaction to a cue
  - The only place needed to apply willpower is to change reaction to the cue
- Cue – recognize what launches you into your zombie procrastination mode
- Routine – this is the reaction clue where you must actively focus on re-wiring your old habit
  - The key is to have a plan, developing a new ritual can be helpful
  - The Pomodoro technique can be especially helpful in shifting your reaction to the cues
- Reward – it helps to add a new reward if you want to overcome your previous cravings
- Belief – the most important part of changing your procrastination habit is the belief that you can do it

#### Juggling Life and Learning

- A good way to keep perspective about what you are trying learn and accomplish, is to once a week write a brief weekly list of key tasks in a planner journal
- Then each evening before bed write a list of the tasks that can reasonably be worked on work on or accomplished
  - Why the evening? Research shows this helps subconscious to grapple with the tasks on the list
- Making a task list frees working memory for problem solving
- Eat your frogs first in the morning
  - Try to work on the most important and most disliked tasks first
- Commit yourself to certain routines and tasks each day

### Memory

#### Diving Deeper into Memory

- We have outstanding visual and spatial memory systems that can help form part of our long-term memory
- To begin tapping into the visual memory system make a very memorable visual image representing a key item to remember
  - For example: Newton's second law (f = ma) could stand for flying mule astronaut
- Repetition is important, even when you make something memorable
- Index cards are often helpful, writing and saying what you're trying to learn enhances retention
  - Handwriting helps to more deeply convert into neural memory structures what you are trying to learn
- Speak material aloud to start setting auditory hooks to the material

#### Creating Meaningful Groups and the Memory Palace Technique

- Another key to memorization is to create meaningful groups that simplify the material
- It's much easier to remember numbers by associating them with memorable events
- Many disciplines use memorable sentences to help students memorize concepts (mnemonic)
- The memory palace technique is a particularly powerful way of grouping things to remember
  - Involves calling to mind a familiar place, like the layout of your house, and using it as a visual notepad to deposit the concept images to remember
  - The first time will be slow, but the more you do it, the quicker it becomes
- Research shows that students who use these kinds of tricks outperform those who don't
- Imaging research on how people become experts shows such memory tools speed up the acquisition of chunks and big picture templates, helping transform novices to semi experts much more quickly, even in a matter of weeks
- The more you memorize using these innovative techniques the more creative you become

## Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential

### How to Become a Better Learner

- Two tips to learn better:
  1. The best gift that you can give your brain is physical exercise
     - New neurons help you learn new things but they will die if you don't use them
     - Exercise also helps new neurons
  1. Practice can repair, as well as train the brain
     - _Fixing My Gaze, a Scientist's Journey Into Seeing in Three Dimensions_ by Sue Barry

### Introduction to Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential

- Learning doesn't progress logically
- Sometimes you hit a wall in constructing your understanding; things that made sense before can suddenly seem confusing
- This type of knowledge collapse seems to occur when your mind is restructuring its understanding, building a more solid foundation

### Create a Lively Visual Metaphor of Analogy

- One of the best things to do to remember and understand concepts is to create a metaphor or analogy; often the more visual the better
- After gaining a more sophisticated understanding of a topic, it's possible to revise the metaphors or toss them away and create more meaningful ones
- Metaphors and models are often vitally important in giving a physical understanding of the central idea behind the process or concept
- Metaphors help glue an idea into the mind because they make a connection to neural structures that already exist

### No Need for Genius Envy

- There's an interesting connection between learning math and science and learning a sport
- For example: in baseball you don't learn how to hit in one day, instead your body perfects your swing from lots and lots of repetition over a period of years
- At some point self-consciously understanding why you do what you do just slows you down and interrupts the flow resulting in worse decisions
- It is practice, particularly deliberate practice on the toughest aspects of the material, that can help lift average brains into the realm of those with more natural gifts
- Whether you're naturally gifted or you have to struggle to get a solid grasp of the fundamentals, you should realize that you're not alone if you think you're an imposter

### Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Life

- There's evidence that myelin sheaths, the fatty insulation that helps signals move more quickly along a neuron, don't finish developing in some people until they're in their twenties
- When you use neural circuits, however, it seems you help build the myelin sheath over them, not to mention making many other microscopic changes
- Practice appears to strengthen and reinforce connections between different brain regions, creating highways between the brain's control centers and the centers that store knowledge
- Taking responsibility for your own learning is one of the most important things you can do

### The Value of Team Work

- The right hemisphere serves as a sort of devil's advocate to question the status quo and look for global inconsistencies, while the left hemisphere instead tries to cling tenaciously to the way things were
- One of the best ways to catch your blind spots and errors is to brainstorm and work with others who are also smartly focused on the topic
